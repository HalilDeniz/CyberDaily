Hacker operating systems are customized operating systems designed for computer hackers to use for various purposes. These operating systems are used by computer hackers to conduct penetration testing, discover security vulnerabilities, find weak points in systems, and gain unauthorized access to target systems. In this article, we will provide a detailed explanation of hacker operating systems.

## What Are Hacker Operating Systems?

Hacker operating systems are customized operating systems designed for computer hackers to use. These operating systems typically include a set of security tools and provide users with various functions such as network scanning, penetration testing, data recovery, password cracking, and other related activities. Additionally, hacker operating systems are designed to help hackers conceal their activities.

## Why Are Hacker Operating Systems Used?

Hacker operating systems provide various advantages to computer hackers. These operating systems include a set of tools and applications that hackers can use to discover security vulnerabilities in target systems, obtain user information, gain unauthorized access, and conduct other malicious activities.

Hacker operating systems can also be used by security professionals. These operating systems can be used to conduct penetration testing or detect security vulnerabilities on a network.

## Features of Hacker Operating Systems

Hacker operating systems typically include a set of security tools and applications. These tools can be used for network scanning, vulnerability detection, password cracking, data recovery, unauthorized access, and other malicious activities. Additionally, hacker operating systems are often designed to help conceal activities on target systems.

## Examples of Hacker Operating Systems

There are many examples of hacker operating systems. Some examples include:

1. [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/): Kali Linux is one of the most popular hacker operating systems. This operating system includes network scanning, penetration testing, password cracking, and other related security tools. It is an open-source operating system that is developed by users.

2. [Parrot OS](https://parrotsec.org/): Parrot OS is a hacker operating system designed similarly to Kali Linux. This operating system includes network scanning, penetration testing, data recovery, and other related security tools.

3. [BlackArch Linux](https://blackarch.org/): BlackArch Linux is a hacker operating system with various security tools. This operating system is designed similarly to Kali Linux and Parrot OS.

4. [BackBox](https://backbox.org/): BackBox is a hacker operating system designed for network security testing. This operating system includes various security tools and provides users with many useful tools and applications.

5. [ArchStrike](https://archstrike.org/): ArchStrike is an Arch Linux-based hacker operating system. This operating system includes network scanning, penetration testing, and other related security tools.

## Conclusion

Hacker operating systems are customized operating systems used by computer hackers. These operating systems include a set of tools and applications that can be used to discover security vulnerabilities in target systems, obtain user information, gain unauthorized access, and conduct other malicious activities. Hacker operating systems can also be used by security professionals to conduct penetration testing and detect security vulnerabilities. However, these operating systems should not be used for malicious activities.
